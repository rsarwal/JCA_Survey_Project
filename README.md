# JCA Survey Analytics Project

This project was created to explore how nonprofits can use survey analytics to drive decisions around pricing, program design, and member satisfaction.

##

Instead of showing the traditional cumulative Van Westendorp plot, I summarized the key outputs as scorecards — which nonprofit decision-makers can understand more quickly. I also added a gauge to visually highlight the price sensitivity range. This lets clients know the psychological pricing boundaries, helping them avoid undervaluing or overpricing their offerings.

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Made This

As part of preparing for the Data Scientist role at JCA, I created this project to demonstrate how I approach survey analysis and nonprofit insights. I believe in using data to create actionable strategies for mission-driven organizations.
